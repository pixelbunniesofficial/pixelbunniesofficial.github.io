              <span class="u-text-white" style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Hello Pixel Bunnies! im so happy to bring to you guys a pixel project that even though being a simple PFP project used to collect and trade, will be growing over time and actually used as a key to get early access on all future upcoming projects! Our team loves the ocean and the acts that people go through to truly care for it and save it so $10,000 from the minting revenue will be going towards Coral.org to help propagate and save coral in places where it is continuously dying. All of our future projects will be geared towards saving the oceans around the world and I really hope that everyone loves the idea and can get behind it to support it because we plan on coming out with many more projects during 2022 that will be more exclusive every time a new project comes around. Every past project will be used to get early access to a newer project so they will continue to stay relevant throughout all the new projects being created! We will continue to expand our team as time moves forward so every project is looked at differently and promoted/ ran differently considering not everyone will be involved in every project we offer. the one you do end up joining will still be as great as the next one available! Hope everyone can get at least one Pixel Bunny and gets to join the family!</span>
